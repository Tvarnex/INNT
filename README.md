# INNT
For INNT stuff

### Before the project can be started
Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
### Start the project
To run this project run:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npx expo start --go
```

Make sure to copy the API key from the report into firebaseConfig.js (Component folder) (did not want to post it publicly on github) 

This will start with expo client on your computer whereas the app can be tested.
Use the expo go commands to open on simulator, emulator, debugger or change to development build
